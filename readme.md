WiiBoard Client
===============

This is a **[Wii Balance Board](http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/downloads/wiiBalanceBoard.pdf) Client** written in C#.
It makes use of the library **[WiimoteLib](http://wiimotelib.codeplex.com/)**, and it is currently used as a walkaround to work with the Wii Balance Board in Unity without using plugins.

_Note: It is not possible to use directly WiimoteLib in Unity directly because SafeMode options. Otherwise, this project wouldn't have much sense ;)_
